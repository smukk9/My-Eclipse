Problem:

	Find all the elements that are repeated in the given List of Llist
	list a = {list1, list2 , list 3};
	
Solution:
	
	Iterate over eachl ist inside the list using two for loops and while doing
	that insert the iterated element of the list in to SET(new created).
	
	As SET only allows unique elements to be inserted. If the element is already 
	present than it will return false. when that happens you add that particular number in 
	to other SET to ensure you have the number trapped.
